<!--Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.
Items in a grid container can be precisely positioned within a defined grid structure.
Advantages:
Ideal for complex layouts with both rows and columns.
Provides more control over the placement and size of items.
Disadvantages:
Can be more complex to set up and manage compared to Flexbox.
Responsive behavior: Images resize and adjust their layout based on the defined grid structure, with columns adapting to fit the screen size.-->
