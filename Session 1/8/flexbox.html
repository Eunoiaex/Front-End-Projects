<!--Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.
Items in a flex container can adjust their size to fill available space and wrap to the next line if necessary.
Advantages:
Great for simple, linear layouts.
Easier to manage alignment and spacing in a single direction.
Disadvantages:
Less control over complex, two-dimensional layouts.
Responsive behavior: Images resize and wrap to the next line as the screen size decreases, ensuring they always fit within the viewport.-->
